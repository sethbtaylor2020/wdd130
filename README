Hi I'm Seth!

As a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho I contribute daily to my individual class discussions, teams, and projects. I coordinate weekly tasks with my team to effectively produce quality programs and projects. Utilize software resources such as GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and SQL Workbench; creating projects such as HTML based web development, improving source code, and creating databases for each project. Meet on a regular basis with instructors, professors and directors to ensure the efficiency of my academic career and the opportunities to contribute my skills in real world applications outside of campus.
